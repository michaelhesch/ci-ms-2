TBU - The purpose of this website is to .

## User Experience (UX) - TBU

-   ### User stories - TBU

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        ##### As a first time visitor, I want to:
        1. Learn about x.
        2. Learn about x.
        3. Learn about x.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        ##### As a returning visitor, I want to:
        1.  x.
        2.  x.
        3.  x.

-   ### Design - TBU
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The page color scheme is based on dark and light gray tones to give a clean and somewhat spartan design asthetic throughout the site.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The font used throughout the site is the Google Font 'Open Sans' which gives a clean and simple font which is easy to read across font sizes.  The goal of selecting this font was to further encourage a clean and simple aesthetic on the site.  Sans-serif serves as the backup to Open Sans if it fails to load.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Hero image utilized across the site presents a dramatic view of a Formula One car with the club name overlayed to engage and excite the visitor about the club.  In addition the landing page uses images of Formula One races in progress to draw the visitor's attention to the key details about the club.

## Testing - TBU

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.  Results of those checks are documented in PDFs included in the project repository and can be accessed by following the links below.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section - TBU

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. Learn about X.
        1. When a user arrives at the landing page of the site, they are presented with a clean and clear menu bar for navigation, featuring the name of the club, and a large hero image section to draw their attention.  
        1. The hero image also features a text tagline to further reinforce the brand of the club and further draw the user's attention.  [View Screenshot](https://github.com/michaelhesch/ci-ms-1/tree/main/documentation/screenshots/Home-Hero.PNG)
        1. Continuing further down the page, the benefits of membership in the club are clearly featured in three large tiles with brief text descriptions of each feature. [View Screenshot](https://github.com/michaelhesch/ci-ms-1/tree/main/documentation/screenshots/Home-Features.PNG)

    2. Learn about X.
        1. The second component of the landing page, after the club benefits, is a listing of upcoming club events by location, including day and time. [View Screenshot](https://github.com/michaelhesch/ci-ms-1/tree/main/documentation/screenshots/Home-Events.PNG)

    3. Learn about X.
        1. Once the user navigates to the Locations tab, the club's physical locations are clearly displayed in a large grid, including the address and opening hours of each location, as well as a map to help the user visualize the location in each city. [View Screenshot](https://github.com/michaelhesch/ci-ms-1/tree/main/documentation/screenshots/Locations.PNG)

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals - TBU

    1.  Sign up for the club using the form in the "Join the Club" page.
        1. After a user visits the page and learns more about the club, they may want to return to submit an application.  This is accomplished by navigating to the "Join the Club" page and filling out a form to collect the user's basic details.  [View Screenshot](https://)
        1. In addition, the user can select their desired membership level from two options, standard & premium, based on the features of each level displayed in the form. [View Screenshot](https://)

    2.  Check for newly posted upcoming club events.
        1. The club events highlight section on the landing page would be updated rountinely by the club as new events are held, and as time passes, so this section will provide a quick and easy reference point for a returning user to view events. [View Screenshot](https://)

    3.  Check the physical club locations across Europe and opening hours of each club.
        1. As the club expands, users can easily view newly added locations on the "Locations" tab of the page, which would be updated to include the address and opening hours details for new club locations. [View Screenshot](https://)

### Further Testing - TBU

-   All pages were tested for responsiveness and any visible bugs using Google Chrome developer tools to change the viewing size across devices.  In addition, all pages on the site were tested for correct behavior on a 27" desktop monitor, a 15.1" laptop monitor, an iPhone 11 and a 10.5" iPad.
-   The Lighthouse tool in Chrome Developer tools was used to generate performance scores and identify areas for improvement in both mobile and desktop views of the page.  Results of this scoring can be viewed via the links below:

    1.  Mobile Scores:
        1. [Home Page](https://)
        1. [Club Locations Page](https://)
        1. [Join the Club Page](https://)
    
    1. Desktop Scores:
        1. [Home Page](https://)
        1. [Club Locations Page](https://)
        1. [Join the Club Page](https://)

-   Please note that while efforts to coprrect some defects indicated in these results are due to issues found in external dependencies, such as Bootstrap's CSS, the version of jQuery used in this Bootstrap implementation, the HTTP version configured in the GitHub Pages server that the site is deployed on, etc. or other faults that are beyond the scope of this project to remedy.
